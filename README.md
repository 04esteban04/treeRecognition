# Tree species recognition systemðŸŒ²

This project is an image processing system designed to classify tree species based on aerial or ground-level images. The goal is to support environmental monitoring and conservation efforts by providing a fast, scalable, and accurate solution for automatic tree species identification.

The system utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically a convolutional neural network based on the ResNet18 architecture, to analyze images of tree canopies. The project includes a full preprocessing pipeline (resizing, normalization, pixelation, etc.), a training and evaluation framework using PyTorch, a graphical user interface for data visualization and a reporting module for exporting classification results.

## How To Use It

### UI

The application offers the user a home page in which it can decide whether to start classifying images or learn more about the product.

### **Home page**

![Home page](./app/UI/static/images/about/home-page.png)

![Home page 2](./app/UI/static/images/about/home-page2.png)

<br>

### **Analysis page**

In this page, the user can decide to do a single, bulk or default classification by clicking in the corresponding button and then, a form will appear asking for the files needed (single or bulk processing) or a button to start the default dataset analysis.

<br>

### **Results page**

Here, the user can see the analysis results. It can toggle between a card-grid style or a table-like style.

![Model metrics](./app/UI/static/images/about/model-metrics.png)

![Model metric 2](./app/UI/static/images/about/model-metrics2.png)

### **About page**

Here, the user can learn more about the product, what it does and how to use it properly.

> [!NOTE]  
> To run the application locally use the command `python app.py` within the app folder. That will load the application backend, serve the frontend files and handle the single, bulk and default dataset classification and report generation

<br>


### CLI
- **To get info on how to use it:**

    ```bash
    python main.py -h
    ```

- **To create and test with the default dataset:**

    ```bash
    python main.py -c
    ```

- **To test with an image path for individual processing:**
    ```bash
    python main.py -p '<image_path>'
    ```

- **To test with a folder path for bulk image processing:**
    ```bash
    python main.py -b '<dir_path>'
    ```
<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For individual or bulk processing, the input files should follow the convention: ```<name>_<treeSpecies>.<file_extension>```
<br><br> 
> For example: <code>img9_oak.jpg</code>

<br><br>

## To Do

- Add a script to install all the dependencies required automatically
- Migrate to a frontend framework for easier state handling, routing and interaction
- Rename default dataset classes to translate it to English (have to change NN train and test functions accordingly)
- Refactor code
- Use smoother animation, components and styles
- Reuse components like navbar, footer, etc
